# ITI Examination System Database

This repository contains the complete database project for the ITI Examination System, a comprehensive solution designed to manage and automate the examination process for the Information Technology Institute (ITI). This project was developed as part of the Data Engineer track curriculum.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is organized into a clean, modular structure to separate documentation from the SQL source code. The SQL scripts are numbered to indicate the correct execution order.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Comprehensive Management**: Full control over students, instructors, courses, branches, and exams.
* **Dynamic Question Bank**: Supports Multiple-Choice (MCQ), True/False, and Text-based questions.
* **Flexible Exam Generation**: Instructors can create exams manually or generate them randomly.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: A secure permission system with four distinct roles: **Admin**, **Training Manager**, **Instructor**, and **Student**.
* **Process Automation**: Automates exam scheduling, result calculation, and answer storage.
* **Data Integrity & Auditing**: Utilizes triggers to maintain data consistency and audit critical changes.
* **Reporting & Analytics**: Offers rich views and functions for tracking student performance and exam statistics.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Database**: SQL Server
* **Language**: T-SQL
* **Tools**: SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), SQL Server Agent

## 🎨 Database Schema (ERD)

The database is designed with normalization principles to ensure data integrity and minimize redundancy.

## 🔧 Setup & Usage

To get the database up and running, execute the SQL scripts from the `sql/` folder in their numbered order. This ensures that dependencies are handled correctly (e.g., tables are created before data is inserted).

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Y0U5F/CRTL-EXAM.git](https://github.com/Y0U5F/CRTL-EXAM.git)
    ```
2.  **Execute Scripts in Order**:
    In SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), open and run the files from the `sql/` directory one by one, following the numbered sequence:
    1.  `1_DDL.sql` - Creates the database schema and all tables.
    2.  `2_DML.sql` - Populates the tables with initial seed data.
    3.  `3_Functions.sql` - Creates all user-defined functions.
    4.  `4_Views_and_SPs.sql` - Creates all views and stored procedures for all roles.
    5.  `5_Triggers.sql` - Creates the database triggers.
    6.  `6_Security.sql` - Sets up all security roles, permissions, and logins.

3.  **Run Demonstration Scenarios (Optional)**:
    Execute `7_Scenario.sql` to see a demonstration of how different roles interact with the system.

## 🛡️ Backup Strategy

A daily full backup job is configured using **SQL Server Agent** to ensure data durability and reliability.
